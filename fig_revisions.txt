#guidance doc figures

-reduce frequency of assessments (5/10y)
-3 scenarios: autocorrelated, prod change, cap change

-reduce ER to really low 0.1-0.2
-simulations at 50-60y
-max. theoretical 

-true status through time
-summary of status
-summary of catch (net differences)
-summary of spawner abundance (net differences in just green zone?)

-might re-run with more realistic parameters to show the risk/rewards depend on the specifics of the HCRs
